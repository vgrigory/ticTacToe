// Hello there :)

// Please serve this project from local (remote) server
// rather than opening it through file:// protocol
// because templates are loaded asynchronously via AJAX calls.

// I've used https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server for that.
//
// It is very easy to use:
// * just follow steps in the URL above to install it
// * go to ticTacToe/ folder
// * run http-server
// * that's it
